* Information

I built Psimacs primarily to be my personal Emacs configuration. It uses many of the
UI features of Doom and Centaur Emacs, but without the heavy emphasis on Evil Mode.

The grand majority of the functionality comes from the MELPA dependencies. They are
installed and configured via /use-package/. One of the unique features of the
configuration is cleaning up the "~/.emacs.d" directory by moving many auto-generated
files to "~/.emacs.d/.cache". Additionally, Some custom functionality and themeing for
eshell is implemented in the seperate "~/.emacs.d/psimacs/psishell.el" file.

** Implementation

Psimacs is an Emacs configuration implemented mostly as a literate org-mode file. It
utilizes org-babel to parse the org markup language file *psimacs.org* and generate a
byte-compiled emacs configuration. The various elisp blocks in *psimacs.org* are "tangled"
into a single source code file that installs external packages and configures emacs.

The init.el file sets up the package archives and /use-package/ so that org-mode can
be updated from ELPA before org-babel tangles the *psimacs.org*. It also loads the
elisp files in the "~/.emacs.d/psimacs" directory before the org file loads so that
the custom elisp is available to /use-package/ immediately when the tangling begins.

* Installation

To try out Psimacs, first move your current .emacs.d to a different location:

#+begin_src sh
mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.old
#+end_src

Then clone the repo to *.emacs.d* in your home directory:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/hjones2199/emacs-invicta.git ~/.emacs.d/
#+end_src

Emacs will install and configure Psimacs's melpa dependencies on first run. The packages
can be reconfigured or disabled in *psimacs.org* See LSP and
dap-mode's github READMEs for tips on configuring their language specific debugging
features.

* Customizing

There is a link you can click at the top of the *psimacs.org* file that deletes the compiled
configuration file, and a new one will be generated the next time emacs starts. This can
also be called interactively in emacs with:

#+begin_example
M-x psimacs-regen-conf
#+end_example

You can also delete all customizations set through the emacs GUI with:

#+begin_example
M-x psimacs-remove-user-cust
#+end_example
